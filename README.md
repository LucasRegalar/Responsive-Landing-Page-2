## Overview

- My second approach to responsive Web-Dev. I only used vanilla HTML & CSS.
- I am pretty happy with my solutions. Already noticed a big improvment in my workflow compared to my first shot at responsive Web-Dev.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://lucasregalar.github.io/Responsive-Landing-Page-2/](https://lucasregalar.github.io/Responsive-Landing-Page-2/)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SVG


### What I learned

- Furthur improved my workflow with CSS Utility Classes

- Seeing the bigger picture of the project. I thought more about long term solutions, which helped me dodge some issues

- I spend a lot of time in a propper root setup, which worked out pretty good!

- Responsive Design (mobile-first approach) & Working with @media queries


### Biggest Challenge

- Getting the bg-image of the testimonials section in the right spot was a little tuff. 
I figured it out with wrapping the hole part in an other div, sizing it correctly and then sticking the bg-img to the left-right corner of the div.
So the "quotes" are always behind the top left corner, regardless the screen-size.

- The Footer took a while. I struggled with the five Column Setup in  the desktop view, because I didn't want to split my code into five Elements, because 
it would not make sense semantically. E.g. I wanted to keep my footer-nav in one nav>-Element. I made it work with three outer columns for the contact-data, the nav and the social-media-icons. Afterwards I split the first two again in two seperate columns to end up with the five. 

I would be super happy about some feedback, to this party of my code. There are probably cleaner solutions right?
